							<p>Capture the Flag is easily the most popular type of game in Tribes 2.
							CTF is a team based game where the objective is to get the enemies flag from
							their base while ensuring that your own flag is defended.

							<p>To capture, you must grab the enemies flag by touching it and return it
							to your flagstand. Your flag MUST be at it's stand in order to capture. If a
							player is killed while in possession of the flag, the flag drops to the ground.
							Unless it's grabbed by another teammate it will remain on the ground until it
							either returns to the flag stand by the enemy touching it or the return limit
							running out.</p>

							<p>It should be noted that if a player goes out of bounds while in
							possession of the flag that the flag will be dropped on the edge of the out of
							bounds boundary.</p>

							<p>When the flag is captured the capturing team receives 100 points. When
							the flag is grabbed from the enemy flag stand the grabbing team receives 1
							point. The game ends when either time runs out (in which the team with
							the most points wins) or when the target number of captures have been met by
							a team (Usually 800 points).</p>

							<h1>Strategy</h1>
							<p>The most underlooked aspect of the game by newbies. You have
							to remember that THIS IS NOT YOUR STANDARD FPS. T2 is not just a run and gun
							shoot `em up. It's a thinking mans game, and if you don't act accordingly you
							won't last long.</p>

							<h1>Communication</h1>
							<p>In *any* team based game communication is essential. Let your team know
							what you're doing. Tell them the status of the enemy base. Give them as much
							information as possible so they know where your team stands and what they
							should be doing. Also, listen to what they're telling you. If the flag carrier is
							requesting backup, go give him a hand. If someone informs you of an enemy
							attacking the generators, go assist them. Respond to your teams requests
							whenever possible. I assure you it's worth the time and effort.</p>

							<h1>Move, Move, Move</h1>
							<p>As the title suggests, keep yourself mobile. A stationary target is an
							easy target, something you don't want to be. The obvious exceptions here are
							when you're in need of greater accuracy for, say, locking on with a Missile
							Launcher, or using the chaingun to pick off a damaged airborne enemy.  Even
							still, in these situations keep aware of enemy positions. If you see an inbound
							Scout with his Disc Launcher pointed at you, get outta there. At any time when you're in the open and not moving, you make a very
							tempting target for snipers. This can be a problem, especially when in Scout
							armor. Keep this in mind when using outdoor Inv. Stations and Vehicle Pads as
							they are hotspots for sniper attacks.</p>

							<h1>Dress For Success</h1>
							<p>Equipment loadouts need to be suited to the task at hand. Going on a
							flag run? It's a good idea not to be wearing Juggernaut armor, as speed and
							mobility are essential. Defending indoors? Leave the Scout at home and get
							yourself some Jug. Think about what you're doing, what is required to do it,
							and equip yourself accordingly.</p>

							<h1>Loot the Corpses</h1>
							<p>When you kill a player he drops all of his equipment, ammo, and packs.
							When you run over said corpses you automatically pick up any needed equipment
							and ammo. This can be extremely valuable as running over every corpse you see
							will keep you well supplied and prolong your battle readiness. There's nothing
							worse than running out of ammo in the middle of a duel, so make sure you're
							well supplied at all times.</p>

							<h1>Remember the Health Kit</h1>
							<p>A number of times I've been in a duel with a player, and when I kill
							him I'll run over his corpse and pick up a health kit. This shouldn't be
							happening. The health kit can give you that little extra edge that means
							survival. Use it.</p>

							<h1>Know Your Role</h1>
							<p>Yeah, The Rock knows his stuff. Pick a task and stay with it. Decide
							what you're going to do, attack, defend, deploy equipment, and let your team
							know. When possible try to fill in where it's needed. If your flag is being
							captured every 2 minutes, defend. If no one is attacking, go offence. Try to
							be where you're most useful.</p>

							<h1>Weapons</h1>
							<p>Primary weapons are the weapons a warrior carries in his hands. These
							can be divided into two types; Energy and limited ammo. Energy based weapons
							have unlimited ammo due to the fact that they draw from the users energy
							reserve to fire. Limited ammo weapons have a finite amount of ammunition that
							depends on the armor of the user.</p>
							<p>Weapon damage is broken into two categories. Direct Contact and Splash.
							Direct Contact means that the weapons projectile must physically touch
							the enemy to inflict damage. Splash damage indicates that direct contact with
							the target is not necessary to inflict damage. The projectile will explode on
							whatever it hits first; enemy, wall, ground, etc. The resulting explosion
							inflicts the most damage at "ground zero", with decreasing damage inflicted
							in the area surrounding the explosion.</p>

							<h1>Grenades</h1>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Basic Grenade:</strong> The Basic Grenade is an explosive grenade that detonates after a few second delay. The resulting explosion inflicts moderate damage to the enemy; the severity of which depends on the enemies proximity to the explosion.</p>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Concussion Grenade:</strong> This grenade inflicts minimal damage to the enemy. Instead, it creates a concussion blast that causes the enemy to drop weapons, packs, and flags. Caution should be used with the Concussion Grenade, as it can also cause the user and any teammates within range to drop their equipment.</p>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Flare Grenade:</strong> This grenade inflicts no damage to the enemy. Instead, it creates a bright flare that serves two main purposes. The first and most useful is that it will decoy any missiles that are locked on to the user or his vehicle, drawing the missile away and disabling it's lock. Alternatively it can be used to signal teammates to a location.</p>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Whiteout Grenade:</strong> This grenade inflicts minimal damage to the enemy. Instead, it creates a blinding flash that can distract the enemy for a few seconds. The severity of the blindness depends on the enemies proximity to the detonation. The Whiteout Grenade has an effective range of 20 meters. Caution should be used with the Whiteout Grenade, as it will also blind teammates.</p>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Deployable Camera:</strong> This item is not actually a grenade, but it's included here because it is equipped in place of grenades, and activated by pressing the grenade button. The Deployable Camera, when activated, will be tossed like a grenade and stick to whatever surface it comes in contact with. The user can then leave the location and remotely view activity in the area via the Command Circuit. Can be used to detect Sensor Jammers.</p>

							<h1>Other Gear</h1>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Targeting Laser:</strong> The Targeting Laser is used for marking targets from a distance. When a target is marked by the laser, teammates are able to instantly lock on with the Missile Launcher, and will have lead calculation enabled with the Mortar and Grenade Launcher. It is also useful for defence by pointing out targets that need to be defended or the flag carrier.</p>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Mine:</strong> The Mine is a weapon that is dropped on the ground. Once deployed the mine lies in wait for a passing warrior or vehicle to run over it. When this happens, the mine explodes causing moderate to severe damage. Mines will explode regardless of friend or foe coming in contact with it. Only 3 mines may be carried at a time by a user, regardless of armor equipped.</p>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Beacon:</strong> The Beacon works like the Targeting Laser, but it can only be deployed by physically being in range of the target. Once in range, the user deploys the beacon which then allows for teammates to instantly lock on with the Missile Launcher, and lead calculation for the Mortar and Grenade Launcher. The beacon can also be used as a marker. If the user immediately presses H again after deploying the beacon, it will switch to marker mode.</p>
							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Health Kit:</strong> The Health Kit is an item that will restore a small amount of damage to the user. A Health Kit may only be used once and only one may be carried at a time regardless of the armor equipped. The exception is if the user is wearing an Ammo Pack in which case two Health Kits are allotted for use.</p>

							<h1>What is LakRabbit?</h1>
							<p>Lakrabbit (“Lak”) is a special game mode in which contestants score points by competing for control over a neutral flag and inflicting specific types of damage to enemy players.  The player with active control over the flag is placed on their own team and become the “rabbit” until killed by opposing players (“hunters”).  Once the rabbit is eliminated their flag will drop and they will be switched back to the hunter’s team, allowing another player to grab the flag and continue the cycle.  This process repeats until any player reaches 2000 points total which will end the match.  Both the rabbit and those hunting the rabbit are awarded scaling point values based on the type of damage inflicted to opposing players.  Lak focuses on rewarding players for their accuracy and precision, making it a favorite among enthusiasts looking to improve their shooting and take their combat abilities to the next level.</p>

							<h1>“I’ve played Rabbit before, how is Lak different?”</h1>
							<p>While both Rabbit and Lakrabbit involve keeping ownership of the flag, Lak differs fundamentally in approach.  In most modes of Rabbit, players are encouraged to play “keep-away” with the flag and score most of their points by avoiding the enemy hunters.  In Lak the rabbit is incentivized to fight back against enemy hunters as they can score more points through inflicting damage on opponents.  Generally speaking, players will be unhappy with rabbits that spend more time running than fighting, and rabbits who engage their opposition will score more points than those who don’t.</p>

							<h1>Basics of Scoring Strategy</h1>
							<p>Rabbits are rewarded with points-over-time which accumulate as they retain control of the flag.  While relatively minimal, these points can add up greatly over the course of a match.  Keep in mind that every point the rabbit scores from control over the flag is a point others are denied, further lengthening scoring gaps.</p>

							<p>In addition to points-over-time, the rabbit has a greater selection of enemy targets to shoot at than hunters, and thus can capitalize on greater flexibility over their engagements.  Similarly, hunters are able to capitalize from the rabbit being forced to focus on more than one target, allowing them to benefit from surprise attacks and openings in the rabbit’s defense.  While the rabbit is technically at a scoring advantage over other players, both the rabbit and the hunters can effectively score points and compete for the 2000 point victory.</p>

							<p>With the understanding that control over the flag offers an edge in point scoring, the bulk of points a player scores will source from damage inflicted made on opposing players.  This is why a player who never touches the flag can still technically win, albeit missing out on the advantages of being a rabbit.  In more competitive of settings, every player should try as hard as possible to be the rabbit as often and as long as they can.  In more casual settings players can find a balance of rabbit vs hunter gameplay, choosing whether to be a ball-hog or sharing the flag with others.</p>

							<h1>Restrictions in Lak</h1>
							<p>Lak differs from most other game modes in that there is a limited pool of weaponry and means by which you can score points/inflict damage on opponents.  The biggest difference is that splash damage is disabled by default.  As stated in the introduction above, the true spirit of Lak is in emphasis on accurate and precise shooting.  Only projectiles landing directly on enemy players will score points, with the exception of hand grenades, mines, and long distance shots (which awards points but does not inflict damage).  The only weapons selectable in Lak are spinfusor, shocklance, blaster, grenade-launcher, fusion mortar, hand-grenades, and mines.  Players may still select between Light, Assault, and Heavy, although Light is by far at an advantage over other load-outs (you will basically never see assaults or heavies unless they are just having fun).</p>

							<h1>Out-of-bounds grid</h1>
							<p>The normal green out-of-bounds grid in Lak functions differently than most other game modes.  In Lak the grid is a solid barrier which players cannot pass through.  When contact with the grid is made, the player will instead bounce/reflect off the grid at an opposite angle/direction.  Players will bounce with higher momentum depending on their incoming speed when making contact.  Some maps such as Mini-Sun Dried have red force field across the grid which serves similar to the ropes in a wrestling ring.  The two “ropes” are positioned slightly above the ground and will catch the player stopping them if they make contact.  Players who touch the ropes will often be vulnerable to attack for a few minutes as it often causes players to get stuck to the rope for a second before falling.</p>

							<h1>Spawning & Invulnerability</h1>
							<p>Players will respawn in a sphere within close vicinity of the flag’s location.  In more recent versions of Lak, the radius is normally smaller and players will often respawn very close to the flag or rabbit.  Sometimes it can be faster to suicide and respawn near the flag than it is to catch up to it.  Newly spawned players will be invulnerable to damage for a few seconds or until they fire a weapon.  The rabbit will also gain temporarily invulnerability when grabbing the flag, giving them priority to make the first move or to put distance between themselves and enemy hunters.</p>
							<p>Hunters are also afforded with unlimited invulnerability to their own discs, so long as the shot did not also damage the rabbit.  This means that hunters can disc-jump as many times as they need, giving them a movement advantage against rabbits.</p>

							<h1>Power-ups</h1>
							<p>There a number of special effects that exist exclusively in Lak.  These “power-ups” help keep things a bit more exciting:</p>
							<p><li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Slap!/Smack!/”What did the five fingers say to the face?” - </strong>
							Spinfusor discs can sometimes knock an enemy player across the map when hit.  When  triggered, an audible “slap” noise is broadcasted to all players and the player who was “slapped” is propelled to max speed in the opposite direction of the shot.  If the player was in possession of the flag when slapped it is immediately disarmed.  This effect randomly triggers and increases in likelihood the closer a player is when hit by a spinfusor disc.  Point-blank discs will often trigger the effect, and even splash can cause it (although no damage will be inflicted).</li></p>
							<p><li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Missile Party – </strong>Rabbits who connect a direct midair disc that scores at least 70 points, missiles will launch from the rabbit’s position.  An audible “jingle” is broadcasted to all players along with a friendly homing-missile for each.</li></p>
							<p><li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">ZAP! Invisibility – </strong>When the rabbit achieves a backlance with a shocklance.  Once triggered, the rabbit will turn completely invisible to hunters.  The rabbit will still be trackable but their body invisible, making them more difficult targets to hit.  Once killed or disarmed of the flag, the effect will end.
                    		</li></p>

							<h1>Point Calculations</h1>
							<p>Points for successful shooting will award based on various factors attributed to the weapon type being used.  When players score damage a message is broadcasted to everyone displaying the values of each factor and the total points awarded.  In addition to the chat message, a ringing noise (cash register, “cha-ching!”) will indicate a scoring shot was made.  The message broadcasted will display in the following format:</p>
							<img src="images/guides/format.png" width="1200" alt="" style="padding: 5px 0px 5px 0px;border: 0;width: 100%;max-width: 650px;height: auto;">

							<h1>Example</h1>
							<p><em>Lone Wolf scores 61 points [Mid-Air Disc] [Distance: 50m] [Speed: 123kph] You receive 53 points [Mid-Air Shocklance] [Distance: 12m] [Speed: 33kph] [Height: 60m]</em></p>

								<div class="col-6 col-12-mobile">
									<p><li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Spinfusor – </strong>Distance, Speed</li>
									<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Plasma Rifle – </strong>Distance, Speed</li>
									<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Blaster – </strong>Distance, Speed</li>

									<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Mine – </strong>Distance, Speed, Accuracy</li></p>
								</div>
							</div></p>

							<h1>Types of scoring shots</h1>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Mid-Air – </strong>Any MA landed on an opponent with one of the usable weapons.  Players must be at least 5m off the ground to count.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Long-Distance - </strong>Plasma, Spinfusor, GL/Mortar – Exceptionally long range shots will score on splash.  Accuracy of splash needed to score slightly differs between weapons.  These do not inflict damage.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Mid-Air Mine – </strong>Mines which are triggered to explode in combination with a spinfusor disc or hand-grenade.  At least 20% accuracy is required to score.  These mines will inflict damage but at a reduced amount in contrast with other game modes.  Only higher accuracy mine combos will have a chance of killing an enemy in 1 shot.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Hand-Grenade – </strong>The only weapon besides mines that can cause damage through splash.  Damage is inflicted at any accuracy although a minimum of 30% is required to score points.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Ground Shots – </strong>Shocklance, hand-grenades, and long-distance shots made on grounded players will still award points.  All other weapon types can only score on air-bound players, but will still inflict damage.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Kills – </strong>Any killing shot will award X points.  No message or sound is broadcasted if not of the above types. Bonus Points are given for kills in duel mode.</li>

							<p><h1>Flag-based scoring</h1>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Points-over-time – </strong>5 points per second while in possession of the flag.</li>
                    		<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Mid-Air Flag Grab – </strong>Flags grabbed mid-air at least 5m above the ground will award points based on the height of the grab.</li></p>

                    		<p><h1>Optional Modes</h1>
                    		<p>Lak offers a variety of modes which by default are disabled but can be voted on.  These modes are usually selected to prevent players from running or favoring the ground too much.</p>
                    		<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Duel Mode – </strong>The rabbit must make kills within 60 seconds or they will explode.  Each kill the rabbit makes will add more time to their counter.  While duel mode is active, the rabbit is not allowed to attempt a disc jump (doing so will also cause them to explode).</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Pro Mode – </strong>Places further weapon/scoring restrictions past what the default game mode offers.  Players are limited to using Spinfusor, Shocklance, Blaster.  Often is used as a means to prevent the rabbit from running forcing them to engage hunters.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#CDCDCD;">Enable/Disable Splash – </strong>Players can choose to re-enable splash damage which is turned off by default.  Often is used as a means to deter players from hugging the ground.</li></p>

							<p>Wing's Script Guide - Written on: May 26, 2014, 05:50:33 PM</p>
							<p>Hello Tribes 2 Community,<br>
							Tribes 2 has been an ever-evolving game since its publication in 2001 by the actions of numerous modders, map-makers, skinners, and scripters. While many players will happily dispute the ethics of modifying their base Tribes Next install, the fact is that most competitive players play a heavily-modified version of the game by using scripts. Many of the features now standard in first-person shooter titles are present in Tribes 2 only in script form. Examples include network smoothing factor (see interpolate below), field-of-view adjust (see zScript-WeaponFOV or uberZoom), radar minimap (see borCChud below), or vehicle mouse sensitivity (see PilotModeIII).</p>

							<p>Most of these scripts are made to gain an advantage over other players, while many are solely aesthetic in nature. It is my expectation that a more balanced playing field will result from these files being available to the entire community. Additionally, these files present the opportunity to modernize Tribes 2 by including some in future Tribes Next releases. I hope that this post fosters a discussion of what direction to take.</p>

							<h1>Necessary</h1>
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Support.vl2:</strong> Necessary file for running any scripts.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Map packs:</strong> All the maps needed for competitive and public play.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">zScript-CleanDSO:</strong> Deletes extra files created by T2 when exiting the game. Avoids script errors.</li>

							<p></p>

							<h1>Advantageous</h1>
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">Interpolate:</strong> Changes how player position data is smoothed out. Many players prefer a less smooth, but more accurate representation of where the server says players are. A more accurate player position will result in fewer “rubber bullets” with chainguns and shots passing through other players.</li>
							The script requires four numbers as input. Values I have used in the past include: 5 25 0 0, 4 20 0 0, 3 15 0 0, 4 7 1 0.2, 3 15 1 0.2. These somewhat ping-dependent values were optimized for a 30-80 ms ping. Ask other players with similar pings for what they have found works best if your ping is different.
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">MultiInterpolate:</strong> Changes interpolate settings for every weapon and vehicle independently.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">zScript-WeaponFOV:</strong> Sets weapon field of view (FOV) independently. A wider FOV is essential for awareness, while a slimmer FOV helps detailed aiming. I use 120 for all weapons besides chaingun which works better for me at 90 or 105.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">PilotModeIII:</strong> Sets unique mouse sensitivity values for vehicles. A 3x boost on mouse sensitivity in the Shrike helped me tremendously.</li>
							<li><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">uberZoom:</strong> Zoom and FOV options. Can be used to set zoom toggle on/off amongst many other zoom options.</li>

							<p><strong style="color:#e2e5e5;">How to use these files:</strong> The textures folder goes in gamedata/base, .vl2 files are compressed folders (opened by winzip or similar tool) that also go in gamedata/base, and .cs files (opened in wordpad or similar) go in gamedata/base/scripts/autoexec.</p>
